# Hash Tables

This repo contains some Hash Tables built from scratch for the "Data Structures and Algorithms for data's Physics" exam I did at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano during my Master degree.

Here you can find:
- `list.h`, where a doubly linked list structure is implemented from scratch;
- `hash.cpp/h`, containing the Hash Tables;
- `func.cp/h`, containing some useful functions (for uploading data, searching for prime numbers and so on);
- `main.cpp`, which can be used for playing with these Hash Tables.
- `Makefile`, which can be used for compilation  of `main.cpp` file. Once it is done, the script can be executed by running `./main.exe`. The Makefile also allows the user to clean the repo removing the executable and the `*.o` files.
